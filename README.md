# hyperskill-zookeeper
### My Zookeper project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number**: #1

**About:** A very basic program for monitoring zoo animals and their status. The program understands the habitat numbers, shows the animals, and is able to work infinitely.

**Learning outcomes:** This was the first project I did in Python as it is aimed at the beginners. Along with doing the project itself and completing numerous problems, I was learning the basics of Python. It helped me to learn the Python syntax basics, and how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
