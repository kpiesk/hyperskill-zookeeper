# hyperskill-python-zookeeper
This is the Zookeper project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course (Project 1).

Difficulty: Easy

About: A very basic program for monitoring zoo animals and their status. The program understands the habitat numbers, shows the animals, and is able to work infinitely.

Learning outcomes: This was the first project I did in Python as it is aimed at the beginners. Along with doing the project itself, I was learning the basics of Python and I completed numerous problems. It helped me to learn the Python syntax basics, and how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
